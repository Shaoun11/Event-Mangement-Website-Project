      "all_details": "Planning a wedding is already stressful enough and now the global spread of coronavirus has placed a whole new level of anxiety and uncertainty on couples_to_be, especially with the CDC's most recent announcement that affects weddings for the next eight weeks, or until mid_May. If you're an engaged couple feeling overwhelmed by the unprecedented situation, we are here to help. Right now, you naturally have plenty of questions running through your mind. How do I postpone my wedding? Will I get refunded? Are my vendors willing and able to reschedule? What do I tell my guests? and while this is unchartered territory for everyone (industry experts included!), you should be aware of how coronavirus may affect though, hopefully, not your wedding, particularly in regards to your hired vendors. To help, we tapped major wedding pros to create a list of the most important questions to ask your vendors at this time, whether your wedding is in the next eight weeks or eight months from now. Take a look at the below to educate yourself and get the answers you need but, at the end of the day, remember we're in this together. Whether you're a couple, a wedding planner, a florist, photographer, or even an editor at Brides, it is everyone's goal to see you celebrate your love safely and as close to your original vision as possible. With spring weddings being forced into the fall and winter, couples are also finding themselves having to change their wedding decor and design ideas to match the newly scheduled season. But Sarah Jennings of Lonesome Valley encourages couples to embrace the new season that you find yourself having an event in. I think everybody’s event will feel differently regardless of how they design it because of the seasonality of it. You never expected to have a fall or winter wedding and it’s sort of being forced upon you, but embrace it."

      "all_details": "Do: Attend the party—and show up on time. Even if you'd rather stay at home in your pajamas, get over it. The office holiday party is a must_attend event unless you have an ironclad excuse. This is your company's opportunity to say thank_you to its employees. Be gracious and show up. If you absolutely must skip—because of a wedding or similarly obligatory social engagement—send your regrets as soon as possible. Once the event day arrives, remember an office party is not a typical social event. This is one time when you want to arrive at the scheduled time—and an occasion when you don't want to be the last to leave. Don't: Wear something provocative. When planning your outfit, think festive but not foxy. In other words, don't grab the little black dress you wore in Las Vegas. You’ll be hanging out with your boss, after all. Depending on company culture, you might also want to play it safe when it comes to holiday attire. You don't want to be the only one in an ugly sweater. Do: Pay attention to the invitation. Before you invite a date, make sure you're allowed to bring a plus_one—and if you're currently single, don't feel compelled to bring a guest. It might be better in the long run to show up solo than bring an unproven Bumble match. Again, your professional reputation is at stake. At some companies, it might be appropriate to bring a nontraditional plus_one, such as a close friend. Figure out if that's the case at your company—and determine whether bringing a buddy will keep you from networking. If it will, try going solo and seeing if you form some new bonds. Don't: Embarrass yourself. Don't embarrass yourself should be rule No. 1 for any company gathering, yet it's so often broken. Alcohol has a way of bringing out interesting behavior. Be mindful of how much you drink, and if you're concerned, drink a club soda or sparkling water. No one will know the difference. You want to stay in control. This isn't the ideal time to dominate the karaoke mic or confess your crush to your cubicle mate."
