        <p className='block font-sans text-center mt-8 mb-16 text-base font-light max-w-7xl mx-auto leading-relaxed text-inherit antialiased'>Sarah Glick and Chelsea LaFollette are the magic makers at Brilliant Event Planning. They believe there is something to celebrate in every moment.  Chelsea is the lead planner  in the New York City office, while Sarah is the lead Boston wedding planner. Though based in two locations, they often team up to create weddings and events together. </p>

          <p className='block font-sans text-center mt-5 mb-7 text-base font-light max-w-7xl mx-auto leading-relaxed text-inherit antialiased'>Sarah's favorite part of wedding day is the first dance, but not because of the newlyweds! It's the moment when the grandparents join in for that first slow song.

            The team fondly calls her SG (even though technically she's SR now) and she's the team's smile instigator. She started freelancing for Brilliant after graduating with a degree in Psychology from McGill University in Montreal. She fell in love with weddings and never left. Now she co-owns the company with Chelsea.

            When she's not planning weddings, she can be found hiking mountains with her husband, giggling and exploring with her children, traveling, listening to crime podcasts, attending Pure Barre classes, snuggling with her fat cat Pip, and munching on chocolate chip cookies.

            You can follow Sarah behind the scenes in our stories, signed “SG”.</p>

          <p className='block font-sans text-center mt-5 mb-7 text-base font-light max-w-7xl mx-auto leading-relaxed text-inherit antialiased'>Chelsea's favorite part of wedding day is when the father of the bride tears up at the sight of his daughter in her wedding dress - it gets her every time!

            Chelsea got her start in weddings after completing her first year of law school. She realized she wanted a career that made her excited to go to work every day. After managing the operations and expansion of a gourmet food company, she joined Sarah's team at Brilliant and never looked back!

            When she's not planning events, Chelsea can be found in her kitchen creating something delicious. Other interests include snuggling her babies, raiding home decor stores, searching for the stinkiest cheese (ask about her family's dairy farm!), and traveling with her husband.
